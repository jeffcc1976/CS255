# Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
DriversPass is a Project for my CS255 class that is to create a Business Requirements Document and a System Design Document.  DriversPass is a similated Drivers education program where the CEO wanted to create an online system where students are able to take online test, register for packages within the course.  DriverPass also wants the capability of drivers/instructors to input their notes.  Full payment processing through either students or through the the adinistrative side.  DriversPass also wants the ability to communicate the most updated DMV procedures that are fully accessible through the students as well as the instructors.

# What did you do particularly well?
I feel that this project was relativly simple irt creating a Business Requirement Document and a System Design document.  I was very familier with the operation and the workngs of these documents to begin with.  I have created diagrams previously and it was pretty easy to navigate.  
#
# If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
Out of all the documents this course presented some challenges. based off the limited information provided I created the documents as required by the specs.  However these documents are just based off my point of view.  Diagrams and the documents should require input from all including the stakeholders.  One person cannot just create it and then expect it to be perfect.  These documents are a work of art. If there is something missing then it should be pointed out.  Communication is key when creating the beginning working of a business requirement document.
#
# How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
When creating diagrams and requirements it is always best to have the best communication is what the stakeholder wants.  Listening to key details, take as many notes as possible  At the beginning of this course, I was able to printout the transcript and highlight key thing that the stakeholder wanted.  From there I was able to create Use Cases and build from there.  While some things may have been missed throughout the process, that is where communication is required between those creating the diagrams and documents.  If there is no communication or if communciation is bad then the project is destined to fail.

How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
